This project is a part of KEA Web Development exam in React Native. Prototype and idea was provided to me by a teacher, but all the functionality and code is made by me. It makes use of Firebase being a database system to store all the users data and profile images. If you wish to see a deployed version you can either use Expo Go app installed on your phone or Simulator running on your local machine. Link to a deployed version - https://expo.dev/@aivarsyo/cbs-student-app .
P.S. This is not a finished version. "Home" and "Discover" screens are for illustrative purposes, everything else is functional.
